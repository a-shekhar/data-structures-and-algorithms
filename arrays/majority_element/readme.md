**Goal:** Given an array arr[]. Find the majority element in the array. If no majority element exists, return -1.

Note: A majority element in an array is an element that appears strictly more than arr.size()/2 times in the array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Since, 1 is present more than 7/2 times, so it is the majority element.
