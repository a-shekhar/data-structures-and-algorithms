**Goal:** Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some
threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetO-fStacks should be
composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity.
SetOfStacks. push() and SetOfStacks. pop() should behave identically to a single stack
(that is, pop () should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
FOLLOW UP
Implement a function popAt ( int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack
