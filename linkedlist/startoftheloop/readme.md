**Goal:** Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the
beginning of the loop.
DEFINITION
Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node, so
as to make a loop in the linked list.
EXAMPLE
Input: A -> B -> C - > D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
Output: C
